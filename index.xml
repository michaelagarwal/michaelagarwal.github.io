      <description>Last updated: 2024-06-19&#xA;❓ What is this technical debt, and why is it considered technical debt?&#xA;Technical debt arises when an organization continues to use outdated or unsupported software. This software, no longer receiving updates or support from software product companies, becomes a liability. The primary issue with such software is security, without regular updates, systems become vulnerable to new cyber threats. Additionally, outdated software often struggles with compatibility, failing to integrate smoothly with newer technologies or systems.</description>

      <description>Last updated: 16th June 2024&#xA;Being a parent for 19+ years, I learned a thing or two.&#xA;Being new parent (0-3 year old kids) First and foremost there is no perfect parent. All you can do in try your best. Trying too hard or setting your own parenting expectations too high can lead to unnecessary frustration. Don&amp;rsquo;t compare your kids to others, each kid is different and unique, they will develop on their own pace.</description>
